# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a structured process followed by software development teams to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain high-quality software systems efficiently and predictably. It serves as a blueprint that ensures software is developed in a systematic, disciplined, and cost-effective way.

##  Objectives of SDLC
-   Deliver high-quality software that meets user requirements

-   Reduce project risk and development cost

-   Improve team collaboration, transparency, and timelines

-   Enable predictable delivery with room for maintenance and enhancements

##  Phases of SDLC
While terminology can vary slightly, these are the standard 7 SDLC phases:

### 1-  Planning
The Planning phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) lays the groundwork for the entire project by defining its scope, objectives, timeline, resources, and budget. It ensures alignment among stakeholders, assesses feasibility, and identifies potential risks. It providing a clear roadmap for the development process.

### 2-  Analysis
The Analysis and Requirement Gathering phase defines what the software must do by collecting and analysing both functional (e.g., features) and non-functional (e.g., performance, security) requirements. Using interviews, surveys, and use cases, input from stakeholders is translated into a clear, structured Software Requirements Specification (SRS) that guides the entire development process.

### 3-  Design
The Design phase of the SDLC translates requirements into a blueprint for building the software. It involves defining the overall system architecture, creating both high-level design (HLD) for system structure and low-level design (LLD) for component-level details. Key elements include database schema, API specifications, user interface layouts, and security frameworks, in order to ensure the solution is technically sound, scalable, and aligned with user needs.

### 4-  Development
The Implementation phase of the SDLC involves writing the actual code based on the approved design. Developers follow programming standards and use tools like version control systems (e.g., Git) to ensure collaboration and code integrity. The software is typically built in modules or iterations, allowing teams to develop, test, and integrate components efficiently.

### 5-  Testing
The Testing phase of the SDLC ensures the software functions correctly and meets requirements. It includes various levels such as unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing to identify and fix bugs, errors, or deviations. Both manual and automated tools are used to validate functionality, performance, security, and user experience before deployment.

### 6-  Deployment
The Deployment phase involves releasing the software to the production environment, either as a one-time launch or through continuous deployment pipelines. It may also include setting up infrastructure, training users, and providing documentation to ensure a smooth transition and effective use of the system.

### 7-  Maintenance and Support
The Maintenance phase of the SDLC begins after deployment and focuses on ensuring the software remains functional, secure, and up-to-date. It involves monitoring performance, fixing bugs, addressing user feedback, and applying updates or enhancements as needed. This phase is ongoing and often the longest, as software must evolve to meet changing requirements and technologies over time.

## Popular SDLC Models
-   Waterfall: A linear, sequential approach best suited for projects with well-defined requirements.

-   Agile: An iterative, flexible methodology that delivers software in small, incremental releases.

-   Scrum: A specific Agile framework using fixed-length sprints and defined team roles for rapid delivery.

-   Spiral: An iterative model focused on risk assessment and reduction through repeated cycles.

-   V-Model: A development process where each phase is directly associated with a corresponding testing phase.

-   DevOps: A culture and practice emphasizing continuous integration, delivery, and close collaboration between development and operations.

##  Tools Commonly Used in SDLC
-   Project Management: Jira, Trello, Asana

-   Design: Figma, Lucidchart, UML tools

-   Development: GitHub, GitLab, VS Code, IntelliJ

-   Testing: Selenium, Postman, JUnit, Cypress

-   Deployment: Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure

-   Monitoring: New Relic, Datadog, Prometheus

##  Real-World Example
Building a Banking App:

- Planning: Define app scope (e.g., login, balance check, transfers)

- Analysis: Gather input from business, legal, and users

- Design: Plan mobile interface and backend architecture

- Development: Developers build in sprints

- Testing: QA tests login, transfers, edge cases

- Deployment: Release via App Store / Google Play

- Maintenance: Add new features, fix bugs, handle updates
